# Crampster
 This project aims to accurately detect physiological activity caused by uterine cramping during menstruation, but may be highly relevant to research and medical treatments for a range of womenâ€™s 
 reproductive health conditions, such as endometriosis, fertility, pregnancy monitoring, menopause, and more. We designed a novel wearable device that collects physiological data via an iOS app 
 during menstruation and serves as a starting point for the prediction of menstrual pain, specifically uterine cramps. We developed two versions of this wearable prototype, each with different sensors 
 to test device efficacy of detecting menstrual cramps: the first prototype using sEMG and EDA sensors, and the second using pulse oximeter and temperature sensors. This repository has the underlying code
 for the iOS app as well as the Arduino code for the wearable belt.
